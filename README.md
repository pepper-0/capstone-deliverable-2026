- My name is Jana, and I'm taking a year-long Capstone class (SY 25-26). My research surrounds the essential question:
  ```How do citizen science serious games enhance public understanding of molecular biology and accelerate research in the discipline?```
- In my primary research, I am following the essential question:
  ```How does participation in a citizen science serious game impact students' conceptual understanding and attitude towards a molecular biology concept compare to traditional instruction?```
  - My primary research will take place over three research methods:

  2. Observation and experimennts
  3. Iterative design (AKA this!)
